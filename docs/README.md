# Getting Started

## PHP Extensions

The following extensions are installed and enabled by default. These meet the Craft CMS server requirements.

> Note: both MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported out of the box; allowing you to move between the two (if required and highly unlikely). This also allows us to maintain one image per PHP version instead of two.
